## About PreferencesAgo
### What it does?
Makes it very easy to get the old system preferences of Monterey> back. 

In order to truly return the ways of old, someone must take it upon themselves to recreate the old. This is a work in progress, the end goal being replication of classic System Preferences; excluding panes that require interfacing with your Apple ID due to limitations. Check out the [completion checklist](#completion-checklist) to see progress.

### Why it does?
Because some of us miss the ways of old (see new [System Settings](https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/06/macos-13-ventura-system-settings-first-look/)).

## Installation
This project is WIP, but when a new build is made, I will upload it fully compiled for public testing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
The app icon used by PreferencesAgo and Legacy Preferences was designed by Apple, not I or dehydratedpotato, and belongs to the native System Preferences/Settings app.

Also, if I mess up implementing some preference and wigs out, I hold not responsibility for bricking your machine or nuking your filesystem.

No one sue me nor dehydratedpotato (amazing guy btw), thanks.
